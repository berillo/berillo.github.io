Welcome to my Machine Learning journey!

This repository is not only a bunch of code, but it is my learning adventure.

I am documenting my path into machine learning, starting from Kaggle exercises and the well-known Introduction to Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng, and eventually my own projects.

---

## Courses I'm following
### Kaggle(Hands-on)
I use Kaggle exercises to get adapted to the machine learning environment.
They feel like a safe playground where I can practice, make mistakes, and build confidence with real datasets.

- [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) → decision trees, model validation, random forests.
- [Pandas](https://www.kaggle.com/Learn/Pandas) → learning to wrangle and clean data.
- coming soon: Intermediate Machine Learning, Intro to Deep Learning

### Coursera(Theory&Foundations)
- [Machine Learning Specialization (by Andrew Ng)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction).  
This is a 3-course program that mixes modern ML with classical foundations.

- **Progress:** currently doing **Course 1 of 3**.  
- Topics so far: linear regression, gradient descent, supervised vs unsupervised learning.  
- Next: logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks.

## My Projects
Right now, I’m mostly focused on courses and exercises to get adapted to this whole new environment for me.  
But once I step into my **“project era”**, I’ll start experimenting with some of the most popular beginner ML projects, like:

- **House Price Prediction** → regression models on tabular data.
- **Titanic Survival Prediction** → classic binary classification. 
- **Credit Card Fraud Detection** → working with imbalanced datasets.

These will appear inside [`/projects`](projects/) as I complete them.

## Tools I’m Growing Into
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn  
- **Next Steps:** TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks, Git/GitHub

## Why This Repo?

My learning path isn’t neat — it’s more like scribbles on a messy notebook.  
Some code here will break, some will be half-finished, and some will actually work (and make me proud).  

This repo is my way of tracking the chaos and the progress at the same time.  
If you’re also learning ML, maybe you’ll find something useful here — or feel less alone in the confusion.
