# Week 1 — Introduction to Machine Learning  

This week lays the foundation of **Machine Learning (ML)** by introducing its main types, focusing on **Supervised Learning**, and exploring the first supervised model — **Linear Regression**.  
I will also learn how to represent models mathematically, evaluate them using a **cost function**, and understand how learning happens through **gradient descent**.

## Learning Objectives  

By the end of Week 1, I will be able to:
- Define what **machine learning** is and identify its real-world applications.  
- Distinguish between **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning.  
- Represent a **linear regression model** mathematically.  
- Explain and visualize the **cost function**.  
- Understand how **gradient descent** minimizes cost and improves model performance.
