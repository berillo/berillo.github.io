WEEK 2 — REGRESSION WITH MULTIPLE INPUT VARIABLES
==================================================
This week extends Linear Regression to multiple input variables (features)
and introduces Vectorization — a technique that speeds up computations
by performing many operations simultaneously. 

I also explore how Gradient Descent works with multiple features, how to scale features for faster
convergence, and how to enhance models using Feature Engineering and
Polynomial Regression.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
-------------------
By the end of Week 2, I will be able to:

* Represent a multiple linear regression model mathematically.
* Implement vectorized operations to make training efficient.
* Apply gradient descent for multivariate regression.
* Use feature scaling to improve convergence speed and stability.
* Understand feature engineering and polynomial regression for complex data.
* Train linear regression models using scikit-learn.
